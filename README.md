## Card Game Mayhem!

A stupid project that, just for fun, gets to try and figure out what exactly would happen if popular tcg card games collided and faced each other with their own rules. TCGs currently being planned to be supported/added include: 

* Pokemon
* Yu-Gi-Oh
* Magic the Gathering
* Hearthstone
* Shadowverse

There will be some slight modifications to try and manage the chaos a little bit (i.e. make sure cards designed to kill 20 health leaders can still kill 8,000 hp leaders from other formats), but this is **NOT** planning to be serious. Just an experiment to see what exactly would happen.
